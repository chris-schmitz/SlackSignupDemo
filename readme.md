# Slack Signup Form demo

*This project is a work in progress*

![demogif]()

This is a demo of a project that I plan to build at the next [Saint Louis Full Stack Web Development Meetup Group](http://www.meetup.com/SaintLouis_FullStack_WebDevelopment/) hack night.

The idea is a site that allows for one spot to sign up and add yourself to the meetup group and to it's slack chat. 

I imagine the actual implementation of this project will be extended to do different things over time which is why the views and routes are namespaced.
